**ChatGPT**, is the new natural language processing tool based on artificial intelligence. It's like having your own personal writing assistant that can help you with everything from writing your wedding speech to writing an academic essay. But, as it turns out, ChatGPT is not only good for writing love letters and academic papers, but it's also causing a lot of concern in the cybersecurity industry.

You see, ChatGPT has the ability to write phishing emails that are so convincing that they could easily fool even the most cautious of us. In fact, an Israeli cybersecurity company, Check Point, has shown how ChatGPT, when used with OpenAI's Codex code writing system, can create a phishing email capable of carrying a malicious payload.

Cybersecurity experts are concerned that ChatGPT's ability to write legitimate-sounding phishing emails will make it a favorite tool for cybercriminals, especially for non-native English speakers. It's not hard to imagine how hackers could use it as a "power multiplier" to carry out all sorts of social engineering attacks.

And just when you thought things couldn't get any worse, ChatGPT has also been found to have the ability to write malicious code. Check Point has reported instances where hackers with no technical skills have boasted about how they leveraged ChatGPT's AI capabilities for malicious purposes. It's scary to think that someone with no programming experience could potentially use ChatGPT to carry out cyber attacks.
